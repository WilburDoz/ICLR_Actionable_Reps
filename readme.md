This is the code for the ICLR 2023 Submission, 'Actionable Neural Representations: Grid Cells from Minimal Constraints'.

Included in the code are:

6 files that perform optimisation in finite periodic of very large periodic spaces of 1, 2, or 3 dimensions
Line, Circle, Torus, Plane, Volume, PeriodicVolume.py

A folder which acts as a module, NRT_functions (NRT = Neural Representation Theory), which contains two files
helper_functions.py - just some helpful functions
losses.py - the losses used
